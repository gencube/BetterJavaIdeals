# NewJavaIdeals
After using Java/JDK/J2EE/JEE/Spring since 1996 and witnessing 
the development of various other languages: 
C/C++, basic, verilog(circuit), awk, bash, perl, VB, C#, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, JQuery,
Jython, D Programing, Google Go and others.

How Java tech MAY looks like to better serve 
the coding community:
* Reduction of Code Complexity(Write LESS do MORE)
* Increase Unit Test Coverage
* More stack and lesser heap for (better server side performance.)


List of changes/updates:
- [syntax](#syntax)
- [Tuple/Typedef](#tuple)  

## syntax


*Smart reference stack object for auto cloning to heap*
* Object to String library exist: toJson(Object), BeanMap(Object).


## tuple

*Like Google Go or C++ typedef struct lightweight objects*
