# NewJavaIdeals
After using Java/JDK/J2EE/JEE/Spring since 1996 and witnessing 
the development of various other languages: 
C/C++, basic, verilog(circuit), awk, bash, perl, VB, C#, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, JQuery,
Jython, D Programing, Google Go and others.

How Java tech MAY looks like to better serve the coding community:
* Reduction of Code Complexity(Write LESS do MORE)
* Ease of change
* Increase Unit Test Coverage
* More stack and lesser heap for (better server side performance.)

List of changes/updates Oracle, JSR or OpenJDK MAY consider:
- [idealjava](#idealjava)
- [stackobject](#stackobject)
- [Tuple/Typedef](#tuple)  
- [syntax](#syntax)
- [class/package exception](#clspkgexception)

## idealjava
How to write better high performance runtime code.

## stackoject
* Instead of Java Object in HEAP, smaller stack object on private thread frame. 
* default to copy by value to pass stack object around.

## tuple
* Like Google Go Tuple or C++ typedef struct lightweight objects*
* Smaller stack object like Tuple

## syntax

* Smart reference stack object for auto cloning to heap*
* Object to String library exist: toJson(Object), BeanMap(Object).

## clspkgexception
* instead of method level exception.
* Class level exception.
* Package level exception.
